#There is also a "native" profile in the Config Server that doesnâ€™t use Git,
#but just loads the config files from the local classpath or file system
#(any static URL you want to point to with "spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations").
#To use the native profile just launch the Config Server with "spring.profiles.active=native".

# absolute paths in Windows require an extra "/", e.g. file:///${user.home}/config-repo
